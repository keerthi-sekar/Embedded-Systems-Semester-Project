# Automatic Disinfecting System
Embedded Systems Semester Project: Automatic Disinfecting System was completed in Fall 2021 (October - November 2021)

Team Members: Keerthi Sekar, Jacob Leisten, Arunesh Mishra

## Overview
This project was developed for automating the disinfection process of a public place with people in the room. The unique factor of our project is the portability aspect so it can handle a variety of room types, not just meeting or office rooms like current products out there. Order of Events in developing this proof of concept: Technical scoping, project proposal, prototyping, demo, and project report and presentation.

### Project Objectives
1. Develop a methodology to disperse disinfectant when motion is sensed and a room is crowded
2. Design a system that notifies surrounding people and users when disinfectant functionality is triggered 
3. Perform system testing and design optimizations or refinements as needed 

### Hardware & Software
* Microcontroller: PIC16F886
* Software (IDE): MPLAB
* Languages: C, Assembly level language
